# Riddle Me This Game

### Description

In this project I created a simple website with the usual HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end and Python and Flask for the back end.

The user is required to input their name to start the game, once in, you get asked 10 riddles.
The maximum score per riddle is 3 points.
You get 3 guesses per riddle. As you use up your guesses, 1 point is subtracted from that score so if you get one wrong guess you will get 2 points, two wrong guesses is 1 point and three wrong guesses is gameover.
Once the user makes it to the end of the 10th riddle, their score will be added into the highscore file and if they make the top 10, they will be added to the highscore page.

The site was made using VS Code and Cloud 9 IDE and tested using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. Several Android devices as well as an iPhone 6s were also used in the testing process. Google Chrome inspector was used to simulate several device screen sizes I could not personally get my hands on.
